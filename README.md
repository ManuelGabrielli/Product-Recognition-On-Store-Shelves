# Product-Recognition-On-Store-Shelves
The Task of the Project is to develop a computer vision system that, 
given a reference image for each product, is able to identify boxes of cereals 
of different brands from one picture of a store shelf. 
For each type of product displayed in the shelf the system reports the number 
of instances, the dimension of each instance and its position in the image reference system.
